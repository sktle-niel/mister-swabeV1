# TODO for Updating customers.php

- [x] Add PHP code at the top to include database connection and fetch users where user_type = 'customer'
- [x] Update table headers to: Email, User Type, Status, Actions
- [x] Replace hardcoded <tbody> with PHP loop to display fetched data (email, 'customer', 'Active', View Profile button)
- [ ] Test the page to ensure data is displayed correctly
