# TODO List for Modifying Customer Main Page

- [x] Update public/customer/main.php to include HTML structure, navigationBar, switch statement for including pages, footer, and scripts
- [x] Modify public/customer/pages/home.php to contain only content sections (remove HTML structure, navigationBar, footer, scripts)
- [x] Modify public/customer/pages/products.php to contain only content sections (remove HTML structure, navigationBar, footer, scripts)
- [x] Test navigation between pages to ensure correct functionality (fixed navigation links to use main.php)
